			<!-- for <a href=""></a> you have different choices when it comes to the href attribute. you can:
				pic\

				1.put an image either from the browser by saving it into a folder and making it local 

				2. or you can just copy the link address and put it within the href attribute

				video\

				1. you can put a youtube video link or other video link inside the href where the img link from either a website or saved (local) image would go.

			Download -attribute


			P.S. the order of attributes that you add don't matter as long as you have got a space in between.

				This attribute instructs browsers to download a URL instead of navigating to it, so the user will be prompeted to save it as a local file. If the attribute has a value, it is used as the pre-filled file name in the Save prompt (the user can still change the file name if they want). There are no retrictions on allowed values, thought / and  \  are converted to underscores. Most file systems limit some punctuation in file names, and browsers will adjust the suggested name accordingly.

				for example if there was a pdf that you wanted some one to download the line of code will look like this:

				<a (you can add it here:)download href="http://web.standford.edu/group/csp/cs21/htmlcheatsheet.pdf" (or even here:)download (it does not matter)>Download Cheatsheet</a> \

				see real example below... i will add download attribute at the end.

				once you click on the link below you will see that chrome actually downloads the pdf, rather than opening the content up on a new tab or on the page.
