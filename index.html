		now for say that we don't want to rely on the internet to be able to display our photo:

		instead we can actually use an image that is within our directory. we can have an image photo in an image folder and allow it to get directed to the folder everytime the website wants to call and load that image-->

<!-- if you notice that when we look at this h3 of "Work Experience" we can see that it loos very ugly and for this purpose we want the data to look really nice... but we aren't using css yet. so what we can do while still just using html is making use of the table tag (<table></table>)


look below for what it should look like.

<h3>Work Experience</h3>

	<!-- tables also have heads, bodies, and footers as an html layout would have.. you can signify these by using:

		thead: <thead> </thead>

				-inside the table head we can add some titles to each of our columns and they get formated in by default in bold

		tbody: <tbody> </tbody>

		tfoot: <tfoot> </tfoot>

	looks for the difference below

	<!-- now the table element also has some attributes that you can use to style it without the need for css. these include...:
		border
		background
		bgcolor
		colspan
		cellspacing
		etc... check out mzd for more attributes

		but we don't have to use it.. matter of fact it is not recommended that we use this. because remember HTML is for struction, CSS is for styling and Java Script is for behavior.-->

<!-- NOW WE ARE GOING TO LEARN HOW TO PUBLISH OUR WEBSITE... SEE THERE IS NO POINT IN IT JUST BEING LOCAL BECAUSE THEN NO ONE ELSE WILL BE ABLE TO ACCESS IT.. SO LETS PUBLISH IT- Below you will find the instructions to do so. 


	in order for us to be able to publish a website we will need to host our website somewhere. now there are a whole bunch on hosting sites such as:
	- GoDaddy 
	- Bluehost

	but because we are learning at the moment we don't want to have to pay for this so there is also a free solution. by the end of this comment we are going to have our personal CV 
		(what is a CV? :Curriculum Vitae
CV is an abbreviation for Curriculum Vitae. If a job advertisement asks for a CV, that's a hint that the employer expects a great deal of life experience and accomplishments, including education, original research, presentations you've given and papers or books you've had published.) 
- up on the internet proudly displayed somehwere, and you will be able to share a url or a link to it so that anybody across the web can be able to access it. 

		BUT 
		first things first, we are going to have to do a little bit of set up.

		the service that we are going to use is GitHub. 
		-github.com
		-create an account *if you don't have one already*
		-create a repository (cloud folder)
		-name the repository "cv"
		-press "upload files" button and upload our files for our cv website
		-select index.html, css, images, hobbies.html, contact.html and drag it into the upload space
		- type a comments in the first comment space (these comments should describe what you did)
		-make sure that button that says "commit directly to the master branch." is selected
		-press "commit changes"


			this will upload the files that we just uploaded into the cloud and now we are ready to set up a page.


		-head over to the setting tab
		-scroll down till you see the section called "GitHub Pages"
			GitHub Pages is designed to host your personal, organization, or project pages from a GitHub repository.
		-click on the none, button within the section and change it so that it says "master branch" 
		-click save.
		-the page will reload, go back down to the "GitHub Pages" section and you will see that you now have a link to your website... you will notice that it is an https, so you can now be able to view the website anywhere in the world as long as you are connected to the internet.
		-now you can go ahead and share this link with anybody that you like across the world and they can access it because it is now hosted on the internet.
